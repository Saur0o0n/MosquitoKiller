# MosquitoKiller

It's a modification of existing hand mosquito zapping devices so it will make more fun to do it - if it's not enought already :)

It ads kill counter, high score and sound effects.

## Components

* Arduino nano (any Arduino will work, this one I had at hand and it's small)
* OLED display 128x32 (called OLED-091)
* ADS1015 board
* DFPlayer Mini with SD card and speaker (I've used old laptop speakers)
* some resistors
